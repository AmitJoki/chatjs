ChatJS
======

[ChatJS](http://www.chatjs.net/) is a full-featured, lightweight, Facebook style jQuery plugin for instant messaging.
ChatJS is divided into two parts: `jquery.chatjs.js`, which is the actual plug-in, and an adapter, which implements the communication between the client and the server. ChatJS comes with an adapter for ASP.NET SignalR, and another one using long-polling, which is intended to be server independent, that is, it will work as long as you implement the proper server-side endpoints. ChatJS sample project works with both adapters.
